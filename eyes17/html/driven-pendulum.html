<ul>
<li>Make a pendulum using a folded piece of paper and two button magnets.</li>
<li>Connect the coil from WG to Ground and place the pendulum in front of it.</li>
<li>Adjust the frequency of WG to find out the resonsnce frequency of the pendulum.</li>
<li>The amplitude becomes very large at this frequency.</li>
</ul>
