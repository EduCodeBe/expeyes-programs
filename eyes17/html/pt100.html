<ul>
<li>PT100 is an RTD sensor, it's resistance changes with temperature.</li>
<li>It is 100 Ohms at zero degree celcius.</li>
<li>The resistance is measured by connecting PT100 to a Constant Current Source. The voltage drop is proportional to the resistance.</li>
<li>It is measured after some amplification, since the voltage is less than200 mV even
at 100 degC.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The PT100 sensor is connected from the 1.1mA constant current source to ground.</li>
<li>The voltage across PT100 is monitored using A3.</li>
<li>The 1K resistor from Rg to Ground, amplifies the signal connected to A3 by 11 times</li>
<li>The temperature and time ranges can be selected before starting to record the data.</li>
