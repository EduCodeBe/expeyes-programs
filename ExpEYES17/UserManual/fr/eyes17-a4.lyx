\begin_layout Chapter
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science is the study of the physical world by systematic observations and
 experiments.
 Proper science education is essential for cultivating a society where reasoning
 and logical thinking prevails and not superstition and irrational beliefs.
 Science education is also essential for training enough technicians, engineers
 and scientists for the economy of the modern world.
 It is widely accepted that personal experience in the form of experiments
 and observations, either carried out by students or performed as demonstrations
 by teachers, are essential to the pedagogy of science.
 However, almost everywhere science is mostly taught from the text books
 without giving importance to experiments, partly due to lack of equipment.
 As a result, most of the students fail to correlate their classroom experience
 to problems encountered in daily life.
 To some extent this can be corrected by learning science based on exploration
 and experimenting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advent of personal computers and their easy availability has opened
 up a new path for making laboratory equipment.
 Addition of some hardware to an ordinary computer can convert it in to
 a science laboratory.
 Performing quick measurements with good accuracy enables one to study a
 wide range of phenomena.
 Science experiments generally involve measuring/controlling physical parameters
 like temperature, pressure, velocity, acceleration, force, voltage, current
 etc.
 If the measured physical property is changing rapidly, the measurements
 need to be automated and a computer becomes a useful tool.
 For example, understanding the variation of AC mains voltage with time
 requires measuring it after every millisecond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to perform experiments with reasonable accuracy also opens up
 the possibility of research oriented science education.
 Students can compare the experimental data with mathematical models and
 examine the fundamental laws governing various phenomena.
 Research scientists do the same with highly sophisticated equipment.
 The expEYES ( expEriments for Young Engineers & Scientists) kit is designed
 to support a wide range of experiments, from school to post graduate level.
 It also acts as a test equipment for electronics engineers and hobbyists.
 The simple and open architecture of expEYES allows the users to 
\shape italic
develop new experiments, without getting into the details of electronics
 or computer programming
\shape default
.
 This User's manual describes 
\shape italic
expEYES-17
\shape default
 along with several experiments, there is also a Programmer's manual available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ExpEYES-17 is interfaced and powered by the USB port of the computer, and
 it is programmable in Python.
 It can function as a low frequency oscilloscope, function generator, programmab
le voltage source, frequency counter and data logger.
 For connecting external signals, it has two spring loaded terminals blocks,
 one for output signals and another for inputs, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-ExpEYES-toppanel"

\end_inset

.
 The software can monitor and control the voltages at these terminals.
 In order to measure other parameters (like temperature, pressure etc.),
 we need to convert them in to electrical signals by using appropriate sensor
 elements.
 The accuracy of the voltage measurements is decided by the stability of
 the 3.3V reference used, it is 50ppm per degree celcius.
 The gain and offset errors are eliminated by initial calibration, using
 a 16bit ADC.
 The time interval and frequency measurement accuracy is decided by the
 12.000 MHz crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though our primary objective is to do experiments, you are advised
 to read through the brief description of the equipment given below.
 The device can be also used as a test equipment for electrical and electronics
 engineering experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\shape italic
IMPORTANT : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The external voltages connected to ExpEYES17 must be within the allowed
 limits.
 Inputs A1 and A2 must be within 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm16$
\end_inset

 volts range and Inputs IN1 and IN2 must be in 0 to 3.3V range.
 Exceeding these limits may result in damage to the equipment.
 To measure higher voltages, scale them down using resistive potential divider
 networks.

What will you get if you subtract a 2.5 from the y-coordinate of every point
 of the first graph? That is what the capacitor did.
 It did not allow the DC part to pass through.
 This original square wave can be considered as a 2.5V AC superimposed on

Observed values are shown in the table.
 The DC and AC resistances seems to be very different.
 With DC, the resistance of the liquid changes with time, due to electrolysis

 The resistance does not depend much on the distance between the electrodes,
 the area of the electrode is having some effect.
 The resistance depends on the ion concentration and presence of impurities
 in the water used.

 Moving a sheet of paper back and forth in air can generate these kind of
 pressure waves, like the paper cone of a loudspeaker.
 When the frequency is within 20 to 20000Hz range, we can hear the sound.
 In this chapter, we will generate sound from electrical signals, detect
 them using the built-in microphone (a pressure sensor) and study the properties
 like amplitude and frequency.
 Velocity of sound is measured by observing the phase shift of digitized
 sound with distance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can display the pressure variation at any point with respect to the variation
 at the starting point.
 The phase of the microphone output changes as you change its distance from
 the Piezo.
 Moving by one wavelength changes the phase by 360 degrees.
 If the phase changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 degrees for 
\begin_inset Formula $\triangle D$
\end_inset

 cm change in distance, the wavelength is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\frac{360\times\triangle D}{X}$

 this.

The resonant frequency of the Piezo crystal is around 3600 Hz.
 Driven by a square wave, the piezo gets a kick on every rising and falling
 edge, and it undergoes several cycles of oscillations at its natural resonant
 frequency.
 The Fourier transform shows a peak at the resonant frequency and side band
 200 Hz separated from the peak.
 It may be interesting to repeat this study using a variable frequency sine
 wave instead of the square wave.

 clockwise at 10 rotations per second will look like rotating anti-clockwise
 once a second.
 During stopping and starting, the ceiling fans sometimes looks like rotating
 backwards, in the light of fluorescent tubes.

Coding expEYES in Python
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GUI programs described in the previous sections are meant for a fixed
 set of experiments.
 To develop new experiments, one should know how to access the features
 of expEYES from software.
 Important function calls used for communicating with the device is given
 below.
 For more details, refer to the 
\emph on
Programmer's manual
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installing the Python Libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expEYES-17 package consists of three files (eyes17.py, eyeplot17.py and
 eyemath17.py) inside a subdirectory named expeyes.
 This subdirectory should be inside your PYTHON LIBRARY PATH ( or inside
 your working directory).
 On Debian based GNU/Linux systems, this will be done by installing the
 expeyes-5.x.x.deb file.
 On other systems unzip the file expeyes-5.x.x.zip and follow the instructions
 in the README file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hardware Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Start the Python interpreter in the interactive mode.
 Type the following two lines to load the library and establish connection
 to the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>import expeyes.eyes17
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>p=expeyes.eyes17.open()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you get an error message, check the connections, close other programs
 already using expEYES.
 Only one program can use expEYES at a time.
 We will start by setting and measuring some voltages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>p.set_pv1(3.0)   # set PV1 to 3 volts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Connect PV1 to A1 using a piece of wire, and measure the voltage at A1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>print p.get_voltage('A1')   
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should print a 3 volts, within the limits of error.
 You can try the same using PV2, A2 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let us explore AC signals.
 Connect WG to A1 and try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>print p.set_sine(100)   # set WG to 100 Hz (or closest possible) sine
 wave
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>print p.get_voltage('A1')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will get different results every time you issue the command (use cursor
 and backspace keys to edit previous commands).
 Since the voltage is changing with time, it makes better sense to measure
 this voltage for some duration and plot it.
 We will import the 
\end_layout

 library for plotting, capture the sine wave and plot it.

In some experiments, the captured voltage may be generated by some other
 actions like changing a voltage level.
 This is done by implementing capture modifiers.
 This can be easily demonstrated by capturing the voltage across a capacitor,
 just after applying a voltage step to it through a resistor.
 Connect 1k resistor from OD1 to A1, a 1uF capacitor from A1 to GND, and
 run;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>p.set_state(1)        # OD1 5 volts
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>t,v=p.capture1_action('A1',300,20,'SET_LOW')  # OD1->0 before capture

expEYES can measure time interval between voltage transitions at the digital
 inputs.
 The results returned are in microseconds.
 Connect SQR1 to IN2 and try:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a captured waveform, we can measure the amplitude and frequency by
 curve fitting.
 The results are accurate with a sine wave input but frequency measurement
 works with other shapes also.
 Connect SINE to A1 and try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>import expeyes.eyemath as em
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>t,v= p.capture_hr(1, 400,50)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>vfit, par = em.fit_sine(t,v)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
>>>print par[0], par[1]*1000   # Amplitude & Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The peak voltage and the frequency will be printed.
\end_layout
