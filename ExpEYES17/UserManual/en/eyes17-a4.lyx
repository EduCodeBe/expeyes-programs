Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PHOENIX (Physics with Home-made Equipment & Innovative Experiments)
 project was started in 2004 by Inter-University Accelerator Centre with
 the objective of improving the science education at Indian Universities.
 Development of low cost laboratory equipment and training teachers are
 the two major activities under this project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
expEYES-17 is an advanced version of expEYES released earlier.
 It is meant to be a tool for learning by exploration, suitable for high
 school classes and above.
 We have tried optimizing the design to be simple, flexible, rugged and
 low cost.
 The low price makes it affordable to individuals and we hope to see students
 performing experiments outside the four walls of the laboratory, that closes
 when the bell rings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software is released under GNU General Public License and the hardware
 under CERN Open Hardware Licence.
 The project has progressed due to the active participation and contributions
 from the user community and many other persons outside IUAC.
 We are thankful to Dr D Kanjilal for taking necessary steps to obtain this
 new design from its developer Jithin B P, CSpark Research.

\begin_layout Chapter
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science is the study of the physical world by systematic observations and
 experiments.
 Proper science education is essential for cultivating a society where reasoning
 and logical thinking prevails and not superstition and irrational beliefs.
 Science education is also essential for training enough technicians, engineers
 and scientists for the economy of the modern world.
 It is widely accepted that personal experience in the form of experiments
 and observations, either carried out by students or performed as demonstrations
 by teachers, are essential to the pedagogy of science.
 However, almost everywhere science is mostly taught from the text books
 without giving importance to experiments, partly due to lack of equipment.
 As a result, most of the students fail to correlate their classroom experience
 to problems encountered in daily life.
 To some extent this can be corrected by learning science based on exploration
 and experimenting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advent of personal computers and their easy availability has opened
 up a new path for making laboratory equipment.
 Addition of some hardware to an ordinary computer can convert it in to
 a science laboratory.
 Performing quick measurements with good accuracy enables one to study a
 wide range of phenomena.
 Science experiments generally involve measuring/controlling physical parameters
 like temperature, pressure, velocity, acceleration, force, voltage, current
 etc.
 If the measured physical property is changing rapidly, the measurements
 need to be automated and a computer becomes a useful tool.
 For example, understanding the variation of AC mains voltage with time
 requires measuring it after every millisecond.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to perform experiments with reasonable accuracy also opens up
 the possibility of research oriented science education.
 Students can compare the experimental data with mathematical models and
 examine the fundamental laws governing various phenomena.
 Research scientists do the same with highly sophisticated equipment.
 The expEYES ( expEriments for Young Engineers & Scientists) kit is designed
 to support a wide range of experiments, from school to post graduate level.
 It also acts as a test equipment for electronics engineers and hobbyists.
 The simple and open architecture of expEYES allows the users to 
\shape italic
develop new experiments, without getting into the details of electronics
 or computer programming
\shape default
.
 This User's manual describes 
\shape italic
expEYES-17
\shape default
 along with several experiments, there is also a Programmer's manual available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ExpEYES-17 is interfaced and powered by the USB port of the computer, and
 it is programmable in Python.
 It can function as a low frequency oscilloscope, function generator, programmab
le voltage source, frequency counter and data logger.
 For connecting external signals, it has two spring loaded terminals blocks,
 one for output signals and another for inputs, as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-ExpEYES-toppanel"

\end_inset

.
 The software can monitor and control the voltages at these terminals.
 In order to measure other parameters (like temperature, pressure etc.),
 we need to convert them in to electrical signals by using appropriate sensor
 elements.
 The accuracy of the voltage measurements is decided by the stability of
 the 3.3V reference used, it is 50ppm per degree celcius.
 The gain and offset errors are eliminated by initial calibration, using
 a 16bit ADC.
 Even though our primary objective is to do experiments, you are advised
 to read through the brief description of the equipment given below.
 The device can be also used as a test equipment for electrical and electronics
 engineering experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\shape italic
IMPORTANT : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
The external voltages connected to ExpEYES17 must be within the allowed
 limits.
 Inputs A1 and A2 must be within 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm16$
\end_inset

 volts range and Inputs IN1 and IN2 must be in 0 to 3.3V range.
 Exceeding these limits may result in damage to the equipment.
 To measure higher voltages, scale them down using resistive potential divider
 networks.

 tolerances.
 To measure the exact value, connect an ammeter from CCS to GND.
 Another method is to connect a known resistance (~1k) and measure the voltage
 drop across it.
 The load resistor should be less than 3k for this current source.

Sound
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressure variations, about an equilibrium pressure, transmitted through
 a medium is called sound.
 They are longitudinal waves.
 Moving a sheet of paper back and forth in air can generate these kind of
 pressure waves, like the paper cone of a loudspeaker.
 When the frequency is within 20 to 20000Hz range, we can hear the sound.
 In this chapter, we will generate sound from electrical signals, detect
 them using the built-in microphone (a pressure sensor) and study the properties
 like amplitude and frequency.
 Velocity of sound is measured by observing the phase shift of digitized
 sound with distance.
